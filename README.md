## How It Works
1. **Tutor Registration**: Tutors sign up and specify the subjects they can teach.
2. **Student Request**: Students select a subject and request tutoring.
3. **Matching Algorithm**: The system pairs the student with an available tutor in real-time.
4. **Tutoring Session**: Once paired, the student and tutor can begin their session.
